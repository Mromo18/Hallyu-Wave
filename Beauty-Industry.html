    <h1>Beauty Industry</h1>
<p>What part does Korean beauty industry play in the idea of the Hallyu Wave?
Beauty Industry
  Makeup trend
  Beauty ideals
  Makeup products
  plastic surgery</p>
  <p>Although the Hallyu Wave was kindled by the surge in popularity of Korean music and TV shows all over the world, the
    Entertainment Industry is not the only one affected by South Korean culture. Another quickly growing market would
    be the Beauty industry which has been immpacted heavily by South Korean cosmetics and beauty ideals. One of the most popluar trends in South Korea
    is to get plastic surgery, and as unusual as that sounds in South Korean plastic surgery is not as taboo as in other countries like the U.S..
    In fact, Seoul, South Korea is known as the plastic surgery capital of the world, with the most plastic surgeries per capita in the world at
    20 procedures per 1,000 people which beats America's with 13 per 1,00o people. Though the idea of plastic surgery is tied into the ideals of beauty
    it is not the only factor that influences this decision.

  </p>


<p>Two other major factors would be the cultural ties and social ties; as unbelievable as it sounds
beauty ideals mean so much more in South Korea than one would imagine especially since it really has been intertwined with its culture. South Korea
has a history of having idealistic aesthetic standards of beauty. One popular ideal is to have double eyelids (Western influence) due to the fact that
the more Western features one posseses the more beautiful they are and this ideal can go as far as to influence one's daily life and work place.
