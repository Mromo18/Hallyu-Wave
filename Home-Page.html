  <h2>What is the Hallyu Wave and When Did it Start?</h2>

<p>The Hallyu Wave also known as the Korean Wave (한류) is the increase in popularity of South Korean culture and more
  specifically its rise in popularity in the Western World. This phenomenon first began in the mid 1990s when Korean Dramas (K-Dramas) and Korean Pop music
  (K-Pop) began to increase in popularity in the Eastern world (East/South/Southeast Asia). Through the technological development of the internet and in
  turn social media outlets such as Youtube this sub-section of South Korean culture has spread like a wild fire throughout the world. By the
  early 2000s South kora has experienced a boom in their economy due to the fact that they have become a major exporter of popular culture and an increase in
  their tourism. The increase in global popularity of South Korean popular culture has prompted the South Korean government to invest in these types of
  businesses such as investing in start-ups, using subsidies, and even using them to further political relations as seen with the K-Pop campaign for North Korea.

  <h2> Will the Hallyu Continue or Come to an End?</h2>
<p>At this point in time South Korea has risen to become one of the most influential exporters of popular culture along with Japan and the United Kingdom,
  this is a signifiant piece of information because the United States has dominated this section for nearly 100 years. As stated above the major driving
  force behind this surge in global popularity is due to the technological developments of social media platforms and has only continued to increase over
  time. One prime example of this ever growing influence is the K-Pop boy group called BTS (Beyond The Scene/Bangtan Sonyeondan/방탄소년단) which has
   slowly but surely become more and more popular in the Western world (especially the U.S.) ever since they first debuted in 2013, going as far as to win
   a Biilboard Award and perform at the American Music Awards within the past year.
